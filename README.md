# Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles for macOS. The script below can be used to install the relevant packages and applications, change various macOS settings based on my preferences and link dotfiles for customisation.

## Installation
To use these dotfiles on your own macOS system, follow these steps:

1. Install Apple's command-line tools, prerequisites for Git and Homebrew:
```
xcode-select --install
```

2. Clone the repository to your home directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/fraserlove/macos-dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

3. Change into the `.dotfiles` directory and run `install.sh`:
```
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x install/install.sh
./install/install.sh
```

This will create symbolic links from the dotfiles in this repository to their corresponding locations in your home directory. It will also install various command-line tools and applications using Homebrew.


1. Update the file icons (terminal icon from https://github.com/jasonlong/iterm2-icons.git).
```
cd icons/
./macos-icons-updater.sh
```
Next go to Applications, press âŒ˜ + I, and drag and drop an icon file onto the application icon.

1. Restart your terminal application to see the changes take effect.
